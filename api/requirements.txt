# Database (choose one or more based on your DB)
sqlalchemy[asyncio] # Core SQLAlchemy with asyncio support
asyncpg # For PostgreSQL (if using)
aiomysql # For MySQL (if using)
# databases # Alternative to SQLAlchemy for async DB access; can use various backends

# LXD interaction
# pylxd # Synchronous LXD library
#asyncio-lxd # Asynchronous LXD library (preferred for FastAPI)

# Optional:
# alembic # For database migrations with SQLAlchemy
# python-dotenv # For loading .env files (though pydantic-settings can do this)
# celery # For background task management (if more robust tasks needed than FastAPI's BackgroundTasks)
# redis # If using Celery with Redis broker, or for caching/pub-sub

# For development:
# black # Code formatter
# ruff # Linter
# pytest # For testing
# httpx # For testing FastAPI endpoints asynchronously
# pytest-asyncio # For testing async code with pytest
